# Homelab Documentation (Mirror)

This repository is a **read-only mirror** of my internal homelab documentation maintained in **BookStack**.

The authoritative source of truth lives in a private BookStack instance.  
Content here is exported automatically and **sanitized for public visibility**.

## Notes

- This repository is **not edited directly**
- Changes originate from the internal documentation system
- Sensitive details (internal domains, IPs, UUIDs, credentials) are intentionally redacted
- The structure reflects the internal documentation layout at time of export

## Purpose

This mirror exists to:
- Showcase documentation structure and practices
- Provide reference runbooks and automation patterns
- Serve as a public-facing portfolio
